# barebones

A few styles to get started with responsive designs. Built using [Sass][]

Barebones is also based on [normalize.css][].

[sass]: http://sass-lang.com
[normalize.css]: https://github.com/necolas/normalize.css

## Usage

If you're working on a sass project, you can just clone this repo into  your
project and require it:

    @import 'barebones/barebones'

If you just want the compiled CSS, you can get it from `css/barebones.css`.

## Support

Barebones is targeted at modern browsers and devices, and (with a few small
exceptions), doesn't use vendor-prefixed CSS rules and may not fully work in
older browsers.
