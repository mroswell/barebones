# Barebones

A few stylesheets to get you started on a responsive design. Built with
[sass][].

Barebones also includes [normalize.css][].

## Usage

If you're working on a sass project, clone this repo into your stylesheet
folder, and require it:

    @import "barebones/barebones";

If you just need the compiled CSS, you can get it from `css/barebones.css`.

## Support

Barebones is targeted at modern browsers, and (with a few small exceptions)
doesn't use vendor-prefixed CSS rules.
